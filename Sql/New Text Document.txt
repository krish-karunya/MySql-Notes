SQL : ( Structured Query Language )

  Let me Explain what is the usecase of SQL

* To Communicate between mobile and memory card we use android os...Same like mobile , we have database management system , and also we have a database were we can save the data ,To Communicate B/W both we are using SQL Programming Language 

* Different types of Database :

 - relational Database
 - NoSQL database
 - Hierarchical database
 - Networking database 

* Most of the time we are commonly use relational database...let's see the types...
 
 - oracle
 - MySQL
 - Sql server
 - postcresql

* We are going to learn MySQL , it is very easy to learn 
* There are 3 types of data 
  - Structured (Excel - defined structure)
  - Unstructured (Social media)
  - Semi Structured -(email)

* Relational Database are table like structure using sql we can communicate 
* Non - Relational Database are  unstructure using No-sql we can communicate 


Commands :
---------

*To create a data base :
create database databaseName

* Before creating table we need to tell which database we are going to use 

 -  use databaseName

* Create a tablet and mention the key name 
- create table tableName(
name varchar(100),
age int
)

*How to insert the value to the table :
 - insert into tableName value("Krish",25)


* To View the Table Data :
- select * from tableName

* To delete the table :
 - Drop table tabelName

* Any data you want alter it 
 -  alter table customer column  customer_address address varchar(100)

* Add extra Column :
 - alter table customer add column mobile_number int

* How to delete the column base on condition : for null we should use null 
 - delete from customer where  Mobile_number is null
common delete :
- delete from customer where Customer_id = 1 => Row will Delete

* How to update the particular cell :

- update customer set customer_id = 5 where name="krish" 

* How to filter the data depend on particular value :

- select * from customer where city = "arni"

* Based on id we can print it :

- select * from customer where customer_id > 5

* How do you delete particular column :

- alter table customer drop column mobile_number

* How do you truncate a table ?
 Truncate is nthg but deleting all the data inside the table except heading 

- truncate table customer 


Aggregate Functions :

sum()
max()
min()
avg()
count()


select * from student

select student_mark from student  => only student_mark will appear 

select sum(student_mark) from student => using sum() adding all the mark gives total

select max(student_mark) from student => maximum mark will be output

select min(student_mark) from student => minimum mark will be output

select count (student_name) from student where department = "cse"

 select student_name,mark from 

Group By & Order By

select * from student where department="CSE"

orderBy :
--------
* selecting mark arrange as descending order :
 - select student_name,mark from student order by mark desc


* To sum all the mark we can use aggregate function 

 - select sum(student_mark) from student 

* How to see the particular department average for "cse"

 - select avg(student_mark) from student where department = "cse"

* to see all the department avg :

- select avg(mark),department from student group by department;

- select avg(mark),department,count(name) from student group by department order by count(name) asc;



Having clause :

when your applying condition to aggregate function then you can use  Having cluse
